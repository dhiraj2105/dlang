## 🎯 Goal

To create a basic interpreted programming language from scratch with clean structure and full documentation. Future plans include:

- Variable support
- Arithmetic operations
- Print statements
- REPL support
- Control flow
- Functions

## How to Run code

```dlang
create a .dlang file with exmaple code :

let x = 5
let y = 10
let name = "Dhiraj"
print x + y
print name

Run the code :
node src/index.js example.dlang

```

## 📜 Sample dlang Code

```dlang
let x = 10
let y = 5
print x + y
