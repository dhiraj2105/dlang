## 🎯 Goal

To create a basic interpreted programming language from scratch with clean structure and full documentation. Future plans include:

- Variable support
- Arithmetic operations
- Print statements
- REPL support
- Control flow
- Functions

## 📜 Sample dlang Code

```dlang
# This is a comment
let x = 10
let y = 5
print x + y
🛠️ Technologies
Node.js

JavaScript

No third-party compiler libraries (built from scratch)

📈 Roadmap
